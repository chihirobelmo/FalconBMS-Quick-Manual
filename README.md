# What is FalconBMS-Quick-Manual

FalconBMS may require a time to install, set up and get used to the UI operation.
The official manual explains what you need to do in detail, 
but for beginners it may be the number of pages that you don't know what to read from where.
So I wanted to create a quick manual for BMS, which made the information more compact.

# The Goal

The goal is to fit on 200 pages and within 50 pages it will describe how to install, setup BMS and fly the first sortie.

# What this manual will describe

- How to install and setup FalconBMS
- How to setup joysticks
- How to build a mission
- How to start a campaign
- How to apply real world weather
- How to plan a mission
- How to Host/Join Multiplayer
- How to Fly F-16 in brief

# How to start

Create a git account and edit `FalconBMS-Quick-Manual.md`.
You can send me a pull request after your edit.
